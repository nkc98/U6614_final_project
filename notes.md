# Data Issues

## ACS only available in five-year samples, single year ACS has a lot of missing data. Should we expand the sample in a wider direction?

We could widen the study period to 2008-2013 and 2014-2019, allowing us to use those two sets of survey data. This would require some back-end reconfiguration of the panel dataset, but not too tricky.
 
## Sex/Race subsamples

Doesn't seem possible because this is county-level data?

## Should we look outside of Appalachia?


## Should we drop Pennsylvania?


## Should we attempt to do matching?
