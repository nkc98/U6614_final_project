# Data Issues

## ACS only available in five-year samples, single year ACS has a lot of missing data. Should we expand the sample in a wider direction?

We could widen the study period to 2009-2013 and 2014-2018, allowing us to use those two sets of survey data. This would require some back-end reconfiguration of the panel dataset, but not too tricky. Would mean that overdose death rates are period averages, rather than single-year estimates.
 
## Sex/Race sub-samples

Doesn't seem possible because this is county-level data? Could try limiting to majority Black or majority Male counties, but would imagine that sample size issues could make things challenging here.

## Should we look outside of Appalachia?

I worry a bit about defining proper scope here. Also probably exposes us to additional OVB concerns.

## Should we drop Pennsylvania?

Would prefer to have a discrete treatment dummy?

## Should we attempt to do matching?

Not a ton of differences between treatment and control groups outside of overdose death rates and racial composition. Still worth trying to match?

## Should we control for number of drug addiction clinics by county?

Is this data even available?
