We're almost done! Here are last steps we need to complete:

# Define "High" and "Low" Risk Counties in the Data

Initial thought is this should be defined by counties above the 75th percentile and below the 25th percentile in terms of pre-expansion overdose death 
rates. Will need to take a closer look at the distribution of overdose deaths pre-expansion to figure this out.

# Write Up for Findings and Conclusion

Basically just need to put our findings into words. Conclusion section needs a lot of work, especially discussion of limitations and implications of
findings. See [feedback document](Feedback-Neil-Nicole.docx) for specifics.

# Pull Poverty Data from the Census

Substitute poverty rate for income in the control variables.

# Change Regression Specification to Event-Study (Opposed to Diff-in-Diff)

See the Medicaid lesson for specifics. Doubt this will change the qualitative findings, but guessing that estimates will move around a bit.

# Add Specifications for "High" and "Low" Risk counties

This should be pretty easy once they are defined. Just need to add to the list of regressions.

# Move Data Cleaning Code Into R Script

Pretty easy, just need to transfer the code from the current R markdown file.
